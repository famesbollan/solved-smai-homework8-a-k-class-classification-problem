Objective Question

Consider a <em>K </em>class classification problem. Total number of binary classifier trained in a one-vs-all setting are    , and for one-vs-one classifier setting are              .

2           Objective Question

<ol>

 <li>Least Square Error</li>

 <li>Maximum Likelihood</li>

 <li>Jaccard Distance</li>

 <li>Both A and B</li>

</ol>

<h1>3           Programming Question</h1>

In tutorial, we saw how to build a multi-class classifier using a one-vs-all setting. In this problem you are required to construct a one-vs-one classifier for the same problem. The starter code is provided in ‘Logistic Regression Excercise 1.ipynb’.

<h1>4           Subjective Question</h1>

Suppose you train a logistic regression classifier and your hypothesis function <em>h </em>is

<em>h<sub>θ</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>g</em>(<em>θ</em><sub>0 </sub>+ <em>θ</em><sub>1</sub><em>x</em><sub>1 </sub>+ <em>θ</em><sub>2</sub><em>x</em><sub>2</sub>)

where,

<em>θ</em><sub>0 </sub>= 6<em>, θ</em><sub>1 </sub>= 0<em>, θ</em><sub>2 </sub>= −1

Draw the decision boundary for the given classifier (a rough sketch is sufficient). What would happen to the decision boundary if you replace the coefficient of <em>x</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>? Draw the decision boundary for the second case as well.

<h1>5           Programming Question</h1>

You have been given a dataset of handwritten digits, the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 28×28 pixel images consisting of one of 10 digits (0<em>,</em>1<em>,…,</em>9) that are handwritten. Using logistic regression in one-vs-one and one-vs-all setting construct a 10-class classifier. Report the test accuracy for one-vs-one and one-vs-all classifier. The starter code is provided in ‘Logistic Regression Excercise 2.ipynb’.
